                The team started from small wishes during the covid epidemic, with 3 people on the main team and an
                outsourced designer.

                <br>
                "This is our brand name!" This is an affirmation from CEO Minh Nhut. Actually, with this name we decided

                Another highlight of the restaurant is that the restaurant has changed to both selling water and selling
                food at the same time.

                <br>
                "What if people are hungry after drinking?" Co-Founder Khoa asked. We have realized the importance of
                food and drink.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since then, everything in the shop has been remodeled to bring the most comfortable dining and drinking
                space for users.

                The final improvement comes from Viet Anh, which is adapting during the epidemic season with the ideas
                of online sales and payment at home. And everything has been arranged so that we can sell both online
                and offline and still ensure the quality of each customer's coffee.

                Codefe - cherished dream from youth ages, start from the beginning of the Covid pandemic and coding projects make people feel that they need a cup of coffee.

                <br>
                <br>
                However if we continue to procrastinate, this effect will fade away, and then the caffeine begins to take effect, we will not be able to sleep anymore.
