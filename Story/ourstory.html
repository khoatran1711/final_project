                The team started from small wishes during the covid epidemic, with 3 people on the main team and an outsourced designer.
                <br>
                The initial name of the group was chosen to show the connection between code and coffee at the suggestion of Minh Nhut. 
                <br>
                "This is our brand name!" This is an affirmation from CEO Minh Nhut. Actually, with this name we decided on our concept with background color, main design and interior design ideas.

                Another highlight of the restaurant is that the restaurant has changed to both selling water and selling food at the same time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "What if people are hungry after drinking?" Co-Founder Khoa asked. We have realized the importance of food and drink. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since then, everything in the shop has been remodeled to bring the most comfortable dining and drinking space for users.
                <br>
                <br>
                The final improvement comes from Viet Anh, which is adapting during the epidemic season with the ideas of online sales and payment at home. And everything has been arranged so that we can sell both online and offline and still ensure the quality of each customer's coffee.
